from tasks import add

result = add.delay(4,4)
result.id # '734348a5-806b-405b-98aa-812972caef9e'
result.result # 8

from celery.result import AsyncResult
myresult = AsyncResult(result.id)
myresult.result # 8

But if you exit python and try the same (which is like doing a new request in Flask):
AttributeError: 'DisabledBackend' object has no attribute '_get_task_meta_for'. Did you mean: 'get_task_meta_for'?

The below does not work either:
from tasks import add
myresult = add.AsyncResult('734348a5-806b-405b-98aa-812972caef9e')
myresult.result # empty

The only way to work is like app2 is doing, using bind=True
